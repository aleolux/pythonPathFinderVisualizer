## Overview
This project is a path finder visualizer, fully coded in python with pygame. It features three different types of graph traversal algorithms and uses random recursive divisions for the maze generator.

## Installation
You can download the windows executable below:

<p>
Or download the source code and:

Install requirements using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and run:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python main.py
```

## How to use
 
- Pick and drop Start/End node by clicking a first time on it to pick it up, and a second time on the grid to drop it.
- Draw walls by left clicking on the grid
- Pick the algorithm of your choice and click "SOLVE" to visualize the path from the Start node to the target End node!

 - Use the "BUILD MAZE" button to generate a random maze

- Use the "RANDOM WALLS" to generate a bunch of random walls on the grid
- Use "CLEAN" to clear the visited/unvisted nodes, "RESET" to reset the grid to its original state
